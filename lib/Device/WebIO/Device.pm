=head1 NAME

  Device::WebIO::Device - Base role for all other Device::WebIO devices

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Base role for other C<Device::WebIO::Device::*> roles.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 pin_desc

Returns an array ref, with each entry being a string description of a pin on 
your device's header.  Possible values:

=over 4

=item * Some number (corresponding to a GPIO number)

=item * "V33" (3.3 volt power)

=item * "V50" (5.0 volt power)

=item * "GND" (ground)

=back


=head2 all_desc

Returns a hashref, with the following keys:

=over 4

=item * UART [bool]

=item * SPI [bool]

=item * I2C [bool]

=item * ONEWIRE [bool]

=item * GPIO [hashref]

=back

GPIO's keys are numbers mapping to each GPIO pin.  The values are a hashref 
containing:

=over 4

=item * function ["IN", "OUT", "ALTn" (where n is some number)]

=item * value [bool]

=back
