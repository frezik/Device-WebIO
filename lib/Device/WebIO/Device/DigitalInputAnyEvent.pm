=head1 NAME

  Device::WebIO::Device::DigitalInputAnyEvent - Role for event-based digital input

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Role for doing event-based input. This does the 
C<Device::WebIO::Device::DigitalInput> role, as well.

Provides an C<input_condvar> attribute. This should be set with an 
C<AnyEvent::Condvar>, and should be triggered any time an input pin changes. 
The condvar should be set with a callback that takes a pin number and the 
current setting of that pin.

Example user code:

  # Setup condvar
  my $condvar = AnyEvent->condvar;
  $condvar->cb( sub {
      my ($cv) = @_;
      my ($pin, $setting) = $cv->recv;
      say "Pin number $pin set to $setting";
  });

  # Setup device
  my $dev = Device::WebIO::AnyEventExample->new({
      input_condvar => $condvar,
  });
  
  # Set AnyEvent loop going
  my $cv = AE::cv
  $cv->recv;
