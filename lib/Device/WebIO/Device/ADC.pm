=head1 NAME

  Device::WebIO::Device::ADC - Role for Analog-to-Digital Input Converters

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 adc_bit_resolution

    adc_bit_resolution( $pin );

Return the resolution for the given pin.

=head2 adc_volt_ref

    adc_volt_ref( $pin );

Return the voltage reference for the given pin.

=head2 adc_pin_count

    adc_pin_count();

Return the number of ADC pins.

=head2 adc_input_int

    adc_input_int( $pin );

Return the integer input value for the given pin.

=head1 PROVIDED METHODS

=head2 adc_max_int

    adc_max_int( $pin );

Return the maximum integer value for the given pin.  In the default 
implementation, this is calculated based on C<adc_bit_resolution()>.

=head2 adc_input_float

    adc_input_float( $pin );

Returns a floating point number of the input between 0.0 and 1.0.  In the 
default implementation, this is calculated based on C<adc_input_int()> and 
C<adc_max_int()>.

=head2 adc_input_volt

    adc_input_volt( $pin );

Returns the voltage level input of the pin.  In the default implementation, 
this is calculated based on <adc_input_float()> and C<adc_volt_ref()>.
