=head1 NAME

  Device::WebIO::Device::DigitalOutput - Role for general-purpose digital output

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 output_pin_count

    output_pin_count();

Return the number of output pins.

=head2 output_pin

    output_pin( $pin, $value );

Set the given value for the given pin.

=head2 set_as_output

    set_as_output( $pin );

Set the given pin as an output pin.

=head2 is_set_output

    is_set_output( $pin );

Returns true if the given pin is set as an output pin.

=head1 PROVIDED METHODS

=head2 output_port

    output_port( $bitstring );

Set all the output pins at once with a bitstring.

The default implementation sets this by iterating through using C<output_pin()>.
Many platforms have an efficient way of setting all the pins at once, so you 
may wish to override this.
