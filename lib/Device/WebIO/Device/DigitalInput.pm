=head1 NAME

  Device::WebIO::Device::DigitalInput - Role for general-purpose digital input

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 input_pin_count

    input_pin_count();

Return the number of input pins.

=head2 input_pin

    input_pin( $pin );

Return the input value for the given pin.

=head2 set_as_input

    set_as_input( $pin );

Set the given pin as an input pin.

=head2 is_set_input

    is_set_input( $pin );

Return true if the given pin is set as input.

=head1 PROVIDED METHODS

=head2 input_port

    input_port();

Returns the values of all pins on this device.

The default implementation iterates through all pins via C<input_pin()>.  
Many platforms have an efficient way of getting all input values at once, so 
you may wish to override this.
