=head1 NAME

  Device::WebIO::Device::TempSensor - Role for Temperature Sensors

=head1 PROVIDED CONVERSION METHODS

These are mainly for internal use.  A given temperature sensor will probably 
return values in one type of unit (usually Celsius or Kelvin).  Use these 
to convert to all other types.

Each of these take a value in one unit, and return in another.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

These all return the temperature in the given unit.  Generally, the 
implementation will return one of these as its "natural" unit type, and then 
do conversions for the rest.
