=head1 NAME

  Device::WebIO::Device::SPI - Role for things that can do SPI

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 spi_channels

Returns the number of spi channels.

=head2 spi_set_speed

  spi_set_speed( $channel, $speed );

Set the clock speed of the channel.

=head2 spi_read

  spi_read( $channel, $len );

Read C<$len> bytes from the channel.  Returns an arrayref of data.

=head2 spi_write

  spi_write( $channel, $packed_data );

Write C<$packed_data> to the channel. This should be a packed string.  For many 
devices, a single byte can packed using:

  my $packed_data = pack 'n', $data;

For an array of bytes, try:

  my $packed_data = pack 'C*', @data;

This can often be different based on the device, which is why we don't do it for 
you.
