Device::WebIO - Glue for the Internet of Things

Perl-based implementation of WebIOPi.  Device::WebIO aims for a few 
improvements over the original:

* Abstracted backends for implementing on more than just Raspberry Pi
* Support for video camera streams
* Written in Perl :)

Implementation is broken into several packages (as of 2014-07-23, not 
all of these are implemented yet):

* Device::WebIO -- Basic framework
* Device::WebIO::Dancer -- REST interface
* Device::WebIO::RaspberryPi -- Raspberry Pi backend
* Device::WebIO::PCDuino -- pcDuino backend
* Device::WebIO::Firmata --  Firmata backend

The goal is to be able to mix and match backends in the same runtime.  For 
instance, you might have a Raspberry Pi connected to an Arduino using 
Firmata.  In this case, you should be able to control both the Rpi and 
Arduino pins using the same REST calls to the Rpi.
