* Split digital_pin_count() into input and output versions
* Pass pin to functions like adc_volt_ref(), as their values could 
  be different on different pins (they are on the pcDuino)
* Read ports (all input/output pins at once)
* VideoStream
* SPI
* I2C
* OneWire
* Serial
* Servos (part of PWM in REST interface, but different role)
* Sensors
    * Temperature
    * Pressure
    * Luminosity
    * Distance
    * Gyro
    * Accelerometer
    * Moisture
* Wireless communication
    * NRF24L01
